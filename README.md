# Pokemon Bingo Board Generator
#### by Will Colding
## Creates a custom Bingosync board with the original 151 Pokemon and nothing else



Simply run it, select a mode, and the program will copy a formatted Bingosync board to the clipboard.

The board will only add one Pokemon of any family, e.g. you won't get a board with both Venusaur *and* Ivysaur, nor will you get one with Vaporeon *and* Flareon. 

This is intended for use with the Ultraviolet romhack of FireRed by LocksmithArmy, as you can acquire all 151 in this version.

## Modes:

### 1. Full 151
This mode is free of restrictions beyond familial repeats. The starters can be added in their base forms.

### 2. Starters Evolved
Final forms of starters will appear, but the first two evolutionary stages are removed. Used to ensure a slightly longer game.

### 3. All Evolved
No Pokemon will appear in their base forms. You must max evolve all of your Pokemon in this one, or otherwise catch non-evolutionary Pokemon. This ensures a long game.
