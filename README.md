# Pokemon Bingo Board Generator
#### by Will Colding
## Creates a custom Bingosync board with ~~the original 151~~ Pokemon and ~~nothing else~~ no other objectives.

Simply run it, select a mode, and the program will copy a formatted Bingosync board to the clipboard.

The board will only add one Pokemon of any family, e.g. you won't get a board with both Venusaur *and* Ivysaur, nor will you get one with Vaporeon *and* Flareon. 

This was originally intended for use with the Ultraviolet romhack of FireRed by LocksmithArmy, as you can acquire all original 151 in this version.

Support is (gradually) being added for Gens II and III.

## Modes:

### 1. Full 151
This mode is free of restrictions beyond familial repeats. The starters can be added in their base forms.

### 2. Starters Evolved
Final forms of starters will appear, but the first two evolutionary stages are removed. Used to ensure a slightly longer game.

### 3. All Evolved
No Pokemon will appear in their base forms. You must max evolve all of your Pokemon in this one, or otherwise catch non-evolutionary Pokemon. This ensures a long game.

### 4. Gen I + II Full
All Pokemon from the first two generations will appear with no restrictions.

### 5. Gen II Lite
Johto-only Pokemon for Gold/Silver. Base starters are removed, along with trade and some stone evolutions.

### 6. Gen III All Evolved
All Pokemon from the Gen III are eligible in the final (or only) forms. Baby Pokemon introduced are represented in their Gen II final forms.

### 7. Liquid Crystal
All Pokemon available in the Liquid Crystal romhack.
